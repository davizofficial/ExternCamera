# 📸 ExternCam – Save Photos & Videos Directly to External USB on Jailbroken iPhone

> A custom camera app for **jailbroken iOS devices** that allows you to **save photos and videos directly to external USB storage** via Lightning (using Camera Connection Kit). Perfect for devices with limited internal storage — like the **iPhone SE (2016) with 16GB**.

🚀 No more worrying about running out of space.  
💾 Just plug in a USB drive and shoot — files go straight to external memory.

---

## 🎯 Why This App?

The stock iOS Camera app **always saves to internal storage first**, and there's no way to redirect it — even with jailbreak.

But with **ExternCam**, you get full control:
- Choose where to save: **Internal** or **External USB**
- Bypass the 16GB limit
- Use USB flash drives like a **memory card**
- Built with native AVFoundation for smooth, iOS-like experience

Perfect for photographers, travelers, or anyone with a low-storage iPhone!

### 7. How to Export as `.ipa` File (Optional)

#### Method: Using Xcode Archive

1. In Xcode, go to:
   - **Product** → **Destination** → **Generic iOS Device**
2. Go to:
   - **Product** → **Archive**

### 8. Re-Install `.ipa` Without Xcode (Using Sideloadly or AltStore)

You can install the `.ipa` again without Xcode using free tools:

- Download: [https://sideloadly.io](https://sideloadly.io)
- Connect iPhone
- Drag & drop `.ipa` into Sideloadly
- Click "Start"

- App will appear on home screen

> AltStore requires iPhone to be connected to Mac every 7 days for re-signing (free).

---

### 9. Use with USB Drive (CCK + OTG)

1. Plug in **USB flash drive** via:
   - **Apple Camera Connection Kit (CCK)**
   - **OTG Adapter (Lightning to USB-A)**
2. Make sure USB is **formatted as FAT32**
3. Open **KameraCustom**
4. When taking a photo/video:

   /private/var/mobile/Media/USBDRIVE/

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|------|----------|
| ❌ "Code Signing Error" | Make sure Apple ID is set in **Team**, and internet is on |
| ❌ App crashes on launch | Check console in Xcode; may need to re-trust developer |
| ❌ USB not detected | Reboot iPhone, reconnect USB, use original CCK |
| ❌ Can't install .ipa | Use Sideloadly or AltStore; free Apple ID only allows 3 apps at a time |
| ❌ Video not recording | Make sure `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` is in `Info.plist` |

---

## 🎯 Final Result

✅ You now have a **fully working camera app**  
✅ That **saves directly to USB**  
✅ Runs on your **jailbroken iPhone SE (16GB)**  
✅ Without needing paid Apple Developer Program
